# atlasmigrator

```shell
go get github.com/special187/pgtestdb/migrators/atlasmigrator@latest
```

atlasmigrator provides migrators that can be used out of the box with projects
that use [ariga/atlas](https://github.com/ariga/atlas) for migrations.

As [recommended by the Atlas
maintainers](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/issues/1527#issuecomment-1465123713),
these migrators expect the `atlas` CLI program to exist on your path at the time
that the tests are run, and shells out to that program to run migrations. These
migrators do *not* call the Atlas golang code directly.


## DirMigrator for Versioned Workflows

The `DirMigrator` runs migrations by calling `atlas migrate apply`:

```shell
atlas migrate apply \
    --url "$DB" \
    --dir "file://$migrationsDirPath"
```

where `migrationsDirPath` is the path to a folder full
of migration files as described [in the Atlas documentation for "Versioned
Workflows"](https://atlasgo.io/versioned/apply).

You can use it like this:

```go
func TestWithDirMigrator(t *testing.T) {
  m := atlasmigrator.NewDirMigrator("migrations")
  db := pgtestdb.New(t, pgtestdb.Config{
    DriverName: "pgx",
    Host:       "localhost",
    User:       "postgres",
    Password:   "password",
    Port:       "5433",
    Options:    "sslmode=disable",
  }, m)
  assert.NotEqual(t, nil, db)
}
```

## SchemaMigrator for Declarative Workflows

The `SchemaMigrator` runs migrations by calling `atlas schema apply`:

```shell
atlas schema apply \
    --auto-approve
    --url "$DB" \
    --to "file://$schemaFilePath"
```

where `schemaFilePath` is the path to a `.hcl` schema file as described [in the
Atlas documented for "Declarative
Workflows"](https://atlasgo.io/declarative/apply).

You can use it like this:
```go
func TestWithSchemaMigrator(t *testing.T) {
  m := atlasmigrator.NewSchemaMigrator("schema.hcl")
  db := pgtestdb.New(t, pgtestdb.Config{
    DriverName: "pgx",
    Host:       "localhost",
    User:       "postgres",
    Password:   "password",
    Port:       "5433",
    Options:    "sslmode=disable",
  }, m)
  assert.NotEqual(t, nil, db)
}
```
